It can be a little overwhelming if you're a startup trying to be GDPR-compliant. If you've done your research, you already know that regardless of where you're from, if you want users from the EU on your platform, you need to comply with the new regulation.

Here's how we did it.

## Rights

The first thing is to identify the rights your users have under GDPR. These are basic, fundamental, and universal. I personally feel that these should be applied to everyone, regardless of where they live.

### Right to Access

The most basic right is access, so you should ensure universal access to your content, product, or service. Users should be able to see how their personal information is processed, how much information is collected, who it's shared with, and so on.

### Right to be Forgotten

As users are allowed to sign up and use your service, they should just as easily be allowed to leave. This means that users should be able to erase all their information, and companies need to ensure complete transparency with deleting their data.

### Right to Data Portability

Users should be able to import and export their data in universal, open formats. How we're doing it at Oswald Labs is by allowing users to export all their data in JSON format.

### Right to be Informed

This not only means telling users when and what data is being collected, but in case of data breach, it is mandatory to reach out to those users and tell them that their data has been compromised.

### Right to Have Information Corrected

Users should be very easily able to edit their information.
