              I spend one hour every week mentoring early-stage entrepreneurs
              and helping them build technology-focused startups.

              The easiest thing to do is write me an email at mentoring (at)
              this domain with what I can help with. I try and respond to each
              email.

                A renaissance entrepreneur. That is how I would describe Anand.
                His breadth of entrepreneurial experience is remarkable even for
                a seasoned serial entrepreneur and ranges from social to
                for-profit.

                Anand gave good feedback from a business as well as from a
                personal perspective. I wish I had talked to him a few month if
                not years earlier.

                Anand just immediately gets what I'm trying to do, with minimal
                explanation, and had some really solid advice on future
                direction. Super smart guy.
