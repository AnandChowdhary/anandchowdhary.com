                A renaissance entrepreneur. That is how I would describe Anand.
                His breadth of entrepreneurial experience is remarkable even for
                a seasoned serial entrepreneur and ranges from social to
                for-profit.

                Anand gave good feedback from a business as well as from a
                personal perspective. I wish I had talked to him a few month if
                not years earlier.

                Anand just immediately gets what I&rsquo;m trying to do, with
                minimal explanation, and had some really solid advice on future
                direction. Super smart guy.
