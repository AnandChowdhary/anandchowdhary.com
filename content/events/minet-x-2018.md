I went back to my alma mater, The Mother's International School, as the keynote speaker for their annual technology and entrepreneurship event, X, organized by the computer club MINET. I spoke about my journey from a highschool student to today, and the lessons that came with it. The talk was a modified version of the NESST keynote.
