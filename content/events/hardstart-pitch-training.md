I'll be speaking at the AKEPT-WIEF Social Enterprise Forum in Kuala Lumpur later this year. The event is a collaboration between the higher education and leadership academy AKEPT and the World Islamic Economic Forum Foundation.

As a panelist on the Plenary Session 5 on "Social Enterprise in Universities", I'll be incredibly humbled by sharing the stage with Talib S. Karim, President, Institute of Business Management (Pakistan); Sharon Feng, Overseas Director of Codemao (China); and Royston Braganza, CEO of Grameen Capital (India).

The event is scheduled to be held on October 22-23, 2018, at the International Islamic University Malaysia.
