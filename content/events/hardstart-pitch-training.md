I developed and conducted a startup pitching workshop for student entrepreneurship organization and incubator Hardstart's flagship pitching event, *Pitch that Bitch*. It was the first time that I conducted a workshop for fellow student entrepreneurs, and it was definitely a very interesting experience.

Since then, I've done the same pitch training for Twente-based accelerator Novel-T's Startup24 Enschede event and for Enschede-based non-profit accelerator NESST, but it was Hardstart who first asked me to consider the workshop format instead of a traditional talk.
