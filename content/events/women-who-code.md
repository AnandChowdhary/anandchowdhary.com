Later this September, I'll be speaking on web accessibility at Women Who Code Cloud 2019, the developer conference taking a deep look at the latest and the future of Cloud-based technologies. My talk will be a 35-minute tutorial on building more accessible websites and webapps, with code samples and research studies.
