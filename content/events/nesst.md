After being featured by Het Financieele Dagblad (Dutch Financial Times) as one of the Netherlands' 50 most-innovative young entrepreneurs and professionals, I was invited by Enschede-based non-profit startup accelerator NESST to deliver the opening keynote for their new season.

This is what NESST introduced the event with:

> Het nieuwe seizoen van Stichting Nesst begint op 7 maart en jij bent uitgenodigd! Anand Chowdhary, bekend van zijn plek in de top 50 van jonge ondernemers in Nederland, komt zijn wijsheid delen en de eerste stap in fase 1 'ideation' wordt gezet, we helpen jou van idee naar BV. Zin om erbij te zijn? De toegang is gratis en we kijken eruit je daar te zien.

Which translates to roughly:

> The new season of Nesst starts on March 7, and you are invited! Anand Chowdhary, known for his position in the top 50 young entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, comes to share his wisdom, along with the first step in Phase 1 'ideation', where we help you from idea to company. Want to be there? Entry is free and we look forward to seeing you there.

Since then, I've also been part of NESST's season 3 as a jury member, pitch trainer, and advisor. I've been working closely with startups and helping them primarily with technology scaling and business development.
