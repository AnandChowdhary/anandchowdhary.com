I organized BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. Programmers, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs came together to build products to make the lives of a billion Indians better. I organized in collaboration with Facebook's Developer Circle Delhi-NCR and delivered the introductory keynote.
