OneUp is the startup accelerator, incubator, and student organization to support entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley. As their first event of the academic year of Fall 2019, Startup Social, they invited me to deliver a keynote about building a startup as a student.

My talk was an extended version of my [NESST keynote](/events/nesst), and explained my journey through highschool, founding Oswald Labs, moving to Enschede, and being at Santa Clara. There was also a 30 min question-answer session following the talk.
