GOGBOT is an annual art, technology, and music festival in Enschede. In 2011, the festival was awarded the National Innovation Award, being the most innovative festival in the Netherlands. In 2018, my team and I were featured in the festival.

The theme for this year's GOGBOT was "FUTURE FLASH 200: From Frankenstein to Hyperbrain". Our project, Frankie, is an AI-powered frankenstein's monster face. Users could talk to Frankie and ask various questions. Frankie uses speech recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis.
