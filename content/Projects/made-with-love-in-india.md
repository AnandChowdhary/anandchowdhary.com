baymax is a Bluetooth-powered smart billboard that actually cares about you. Privacy-first and context-aware, it connects with your smartphone via Bluetooth and shows you relevant advertisements and information.

Users can open the baymax app and set their preferences by assigning points from 0 to 10 to everything you they like â€” from technology and fashion to food and the weather. baymax listens to the app and securely transfers their preference data. It then understands their preferences and shows them the best, most relevant advertisements from multiple sources. With multiple users, it finds their common intersts and shows what works for everyone.

This was my project for the module "Smart Environments", a quarter of Creative Technology BSc's first year focused on ubitiquous computing and the Internet of Things.

It wouldn've have been possible without our module coordinator <a href="http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~scholten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hans Scholten</a>.</footer>
