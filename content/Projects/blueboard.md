From February to April 2018, my project group and I worked with IBM on building an escape room usingâ€”and to teach players aboutâ€”the Internet of Things. Using Wemoses and Ardiuos as the basic building blocks, combined with Firebase's real-time database and a custom-built Vue.js app, we built a proof-of-concept with five connected puzzles.

This was my project for the module "Living and Working Tomorrow", a quarter of Creative Technology BSc's first year focused on working with external clients on solving today's problems using tomorrow's technology.
