The product was a progressive web app built using Vue/Nuxt.js powered by Django and Firebase.

The app also included Oswald Labs' accessibility features to make it more usable for student with dyslexia, visual impairment, and more disabilities, along with a chatbot to answer students' frequently asked questions which could be trained by all teachers.
