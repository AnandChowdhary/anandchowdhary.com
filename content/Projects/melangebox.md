In early 2017, Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi and I co-founded Melangebox, a fashion ecommerce startup. I designed the brand identity and developed a mobile-first Shopify store, and Mahendra handled the production, inventory, and shipping. In mid-2018, we had grown to over â‚¹50,000 ($750) in revenue every day and continue to grow.
