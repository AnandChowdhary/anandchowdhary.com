Naari is the end-to-end period healthcare companionâ€”from giving you personalized tampon recommendations using P&G's survey data and HPE's machine learning APIs, to getting those products delivered to your doorstep via Amazon.

> <span>Great use of machine learning to drive a benefit for women.</span>
> <span>-- <cite>Erik Hasenoehrl, Research Fellow, Procter & Gamble</cite></span>

Naari is also a social platform that lets you chat with your doctor, friends, or anonymously in a group to find someone who has previously experienced what you are experiencing and express yourself freely, and get a daily curated feed of women's health articles and news from leading journals.

> <span>Takes care of both health and cultural aspects [of sexual health.]</span>
