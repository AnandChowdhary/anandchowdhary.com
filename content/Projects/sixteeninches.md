SixteenInches.com is one of the fastest-growing online supplements store. It was built on a foundation of authenticity and quality-control, both of which currently lack the healthcare industry. I was hired to design the SixteenInches' brand identity, including logo and social media design, and a responsive ecommerce website on the WordPress platform using Woocommerce, to convey their mission.

I chose red as the primary brand color because it represents power and passion. The straight cut '1' and the circular '6' showcase a harmonic balance between work and exercise. The Woocommerce theme was designed in HTML, CSS, and PHP with SEO and mobile responsiveness in mind. The mobile website looks and feels like a native app and provides an exceptional user interface.
