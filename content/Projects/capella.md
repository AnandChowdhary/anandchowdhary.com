At the Amsterdam Dance Event's hackathon in October 2017, I built Capella in 24 hours, a Progressive Web App that lets you find your friends in concerts using location sharing. You can also make new friends based on similar music taste and discover venue heat-maps.

The app was built using HTML5 with a PHP backend integrated with some machine learning and music tagging APIs. The Spotify-inspired dark UI was also designed, along with a beautiful app icon.
