In February and March 2018, I worked with DrillMaps, a horizontal directional drilling startup based in Seattle, WA. I designed and developed their new website, along with coherent icons for their products.

The website was built using Vue.js and included Firebase's authentication and real-time database for mapping and visualization. It also integrated with Chargebee and Stripe for billing and subscriptions.
