Music has always been an integral part of our lives. Ever since people started using the internet, they've been downloading music and movies. The process became relatively simple with the introduction of Napster in 1999, which led to the development of many such tools. I remember growing up with Limewire and Bearshare. After the discontinuation of these services in after ten long years, downloading music became really complicated again.

In the 2010s, people stream music on YouTube or Spotify or SoundCloud and use conversion tools to download MP3 files, or use services such as BeeMP3 or MP3Skull which are full of advertisements, fake links, and incomplete collections. I, too, had the same problem, and decided to fix it.

In January, I started the development of an API called RhythmSaga that allowed developers to fetch album art and information about music such as artist information, tracks, pictures, etc. which I released on Github.

As a proof of concept, I made an app for Android and the web, called Saga. Download or stream as many song as you like, get recommendations based on your taste, create playlists, and share your favorite music with friends, all for free. Saga is beautifully designed and runs on all Android versions as low as Gingerbread 2.3.
