I worked with CSU, the Netherlands' second-largest cleaning service provider, during the first weekend of March 2018 in the Philips Stadion in Eindhoven as part of their first hackathon, Bright Future Hack. CSUnite is an app for hyperlocal on-demand cleaning services, along with a built-in training and communication platform for employees.

The Progressive Web App was built using Vue.js and Vuetify.js (a material design framework) in 24 hours. It also featured accessibility settings and user ratings, and our pitch included concepts of VR training using Google Cardboard and an Apple Watch app.
