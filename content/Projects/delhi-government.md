In April and May, 2016, I worked with a small team at the Government of Delhi's Directorate of Education to try and streamline the process of communication between state schools and the Directorate. Today, if a school principal has a problem, she has to report a grievance, wait for a response, get redirected to the correct department, find someone, address the problem, and it keeps going on and on. We redesigned this process from group up for efficient, two-way communication.

An SMC (School Management Committee) consist of the Principal, parents, and government representatives, who make sure that their school progresses. This app, SMC Management, is a way to keep track of their progress reports and implementation, and I was responsible for leading the user interface design for the Android app. I adhered to Material Design principals and designed a functional yet simple app.
