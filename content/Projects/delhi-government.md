In April and May, 2016, I worked with a small team at the Government of Delhi's Directorate of Education to try and streamline the process of communication between state schools and the Directorate. Today, if a school principal has a problem, she has to report a grievance, wait for a response, get redirected to the correct department, find someone, address the problem, and it keeps going on and on. We redesigned this process from group up for efficient, two-way communication.

I worked directly under Atishi Marlena, Advisor to the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia.

An SMC (School Management Committee) consist of the Principal, parents, and government representatives, who make sure that their school progresses. This app, SMC Management, is a way to keep track of their progress reports and implementation, and I was responsible for leading the user interface design for the Android app. I adhered to Material Design principals and designed a functional yet simple app.
