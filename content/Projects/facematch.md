From February to April 2018, my project group and I worked with IBM on building an escape room usingâ€”and to teach players aboutâ€”the Internet of Things. Using Wemoses and Ardiuos as the basic building blocks, combined with Firebase's real-time database and a custom-built Vue.js app, we built a proof-of-concept with five connected puzzles.

<footer>This project was done in collaboration with Babiche Pompe ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±, Jenneke van Beurden ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±, Kairtian Tijben ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±, Laura MaÅ¡kanceva ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡», and Rezfan Pawirotaroeno ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡·. It wouldn've have been possible without Manfred Overmeen from IBM and our module coordinator <a href="http://edwindertien.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edwin Dertien</a>.</footer>
