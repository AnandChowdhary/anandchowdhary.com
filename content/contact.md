## PGP

If you want to send an encrypted email, you can [download my PGP public key](/files/public-key.asc) and drop me a line at [anandchowdhary@pm.me](mailto:anandchowdhary@pm.me). Note that I don't check my Proton Mail email as frequently as the contact form above, so time-to-reply may be longer.
