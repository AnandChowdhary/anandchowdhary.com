I build and published my first personal website in 2008. You're currently visiting the 10th version of this website.

## v10 (Current version) - January 2020

This website was developed in the JAM stack using Eleventy, designed with Sass, templated in Nunjucks, and written in Markdown. It looks very similar to my previous website, but has some new content categories and a completely different stack. The typefaces are IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Serif, delivered by Google Fonts.
