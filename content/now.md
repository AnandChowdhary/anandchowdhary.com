_On this page, you can find out what I'm up to... like right now. It's my [/now](https://nownownow.com) page._

## Late 2020

- In November, Sukriti got accepted to the MA program at the University of Groningen, so I applied for my orientation year visa and have started looking for apartments there
- I'm continuing working on finding Koj's product-market fit and developing our early technology, including a fun new onboarding flow for new customers
- I made Upptime, an open-source GitHub-powered uptime monitor/status page, and it became very popular with 3k+ stars on GitHub, so I keep adding new features every now and then

## Mid 2020

- I started working full-time on Koj starting July 1
- In August, my parents, my brother, and I moved to a much nicer apartment nextdoor; and in September, my dad and brother got the coronavirus, so we were in lockdown mode for the month
