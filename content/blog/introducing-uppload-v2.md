In April 2018, I made the first commit to Uppload ([56bd930](https://github.com/elninotech/uppload/commit/56bd9307a020c692ed1383f0f4731690c00d90c9)) and pitched it as an idea to [Michael](/@michael), the founder of El Ni√±o, to fund the development of an open-source JavaScript file uploader, something that the web desperately needed. Later that summer, we [launched Uppload](/blog/introducing-uppload) and started using it in our projects. Today, I'm proud to launch **Uppload v2**, a rewrite from the group up in TypeScript, with support for over 30 a-la-carte plugins, keeping the same powerful API, easy-to-use interface, and browser support.
