In April 2018, I made the first commit to Uppload ([56bd930](https://github.com/elninotech/uppload/commit/56bd9307a020c692ed1383f0f4731690c00d90c9)) and pitched it as an idea to Michael, the founder of El Niño, to fund the development of an open-source JavaScript file uploader, something that the web desperately needed. Later that summer, we launched Uppload and started using it in our projects.

Today, I'm proud to launch [**Uppload v2**](/projects/open-source/uppload/), a rewrite from the group up in TypeScript, with support for over 30 a-la-carte plugins, keeping the same powerful API, easy-to-use interface, and browser support.
