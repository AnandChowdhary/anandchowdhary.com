I spend one to two hours every week mentoring early-stage entrepreneurs and helping them build technology-focused startups.

## Getting started

The easiest thing to do is write me an email at mentoring@anandchowdhary.com with what I can help with. I try and respond to each email.

## GrowthMentor

I schedule free mentoring sessions through [GrowthMentor](https://app.growthmentor.com/mentors/anand-chowdhary). If you're not part of GrowthMentor, you can also schedule a call using my personal [Calendly](https://calendly.com/anandchowdhary), just make sure you've already reached out to me via email before requesting a call.

Here are some of the nice things people have said about me:

> A renaissance entrepreneur? That is how I would describe Anand. His breadth of entreprenuerial experience is remakable even for a seaonded serial entrepreneur and ranges from social to for-profit. – <cite><a href="https://people.utwente.nl/r.harms">Rainer Harms</a>, Associate Professor at University of Twente</cite>

> Anand gave good feedback from a business as well as from a personal perspective. I wish I had talked to him a few month if not years earlier. – <cite><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrik-henze-7a8ba122/">Hendrik Henze</a>, entrepreneur from Göttingen</cite>

> Anand just immediately gets what I'm trying to do, with minimal explanation, and had some really solid advice on future direction. Super smart guy. – <cite><a href="linkedin.com/in/mjt145/">Michael Taylor</a>, co-founder and COO of Ladder</cite>
