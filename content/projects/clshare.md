On a Thursday/Friday in November 2018, my team and I built and presented CLShare, an app to help CLS Group with employee engagement. The app was the winner of the [CLS Engagement App Challenge](https://clsinnovation.bemyapp.com/) in London and uses a combination of an AI chatbot with employee-to-employee communication to foster engagement.

The product was a progressive web app built using Vue/Nuxt.js powered by Firebase. Employers and HR staff could visualize emotions of their employees' conversations using sentimental analysis (without sharing the contents of said chats) and also receive anonymous feedback.

The app also included Oswald Labs' accessibility features to make it more usable for users with dyslexia, visual impairment, and more disabilities, along with Ara's AI-powered meeting scheduling features.
