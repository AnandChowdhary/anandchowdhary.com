My first "real" co-foundership experience was when a student of the National Instutite of Technology (NIT) Calicut, Shivam Soon, reached out to me with the idea of building a platform where students can buy, sell, and trade old books. He saw a great opportunity to formalize the exchange process of expensive university textbooks.

I don't count PickQuick as my first startup, because we didn't figure out a business plan and my role was limited to design and engineering, but it was one of my first end-to-end PHP/MySQL platform development projects.
