During the third weekend of May, my team and I participated in the [TechCrunch Hackathon](https://techcrunch.com/events/techcrunch-hackathon-at-vivatech-2019/) at Vivatech 2019 in the Corvid by Wix category. The challenge was to build a developer productivity tool using Wix's new platform.

Our winning product was a Scrum/Agile platform to mitigate errors. The workflow showed insights into where errors are coming from (browsers, lines of code, etc.), and showed intelligent suggestions using StackOverflow. To track errors, we actually ended up building an open-source project which listens for errors and sends them to your tracking backend.

The product was a Corvid web app built using their components and custom frontend and backend JavaScript. It also integrated with several Corvid features, like comments, repeaters, and more.
