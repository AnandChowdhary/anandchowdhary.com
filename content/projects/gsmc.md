From May to July 2012, I worked as an intern at Global School of Media Crafting (GSMC), a "new-age media school" in New Delhi. This was my first internship, and I designed a new brand identity for the institute, including a logo, website, and marketing materials like banners, posters, and brochures. I also learned video editing, film production, and screen design techniques and worked directly under celebrated media personality Kanupriya.
