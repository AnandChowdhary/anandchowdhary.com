From September to December 2019, I studied Typography at Santa Clara University in California as part of my minor semester abroad. One of the projects I designed was a brochure, ticket, and design system for a typography event featuring iconic designer Tobias Frere-Jones.

Because there were very few high-resolution photos of Tobias, I used this vectorized image style with bright colors.
