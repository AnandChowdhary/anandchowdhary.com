Between November 29 and December 1, 2018, my team and I built and presented Aristotle, an AI-powered e-learning platform for the schools of Limburg. The app was the winner of the *Education* category at [Brighthack](http://brighthack.eu) in Heerlen.

For students, it automatically finds the best content from a variety of sources (like Khan Academy, Wikipedia, study material websites, etc.), and offers gamification and quizzes to better understand the syllabus. For teachers, it offers actionable analytics such as per-student performance. For the government, it offers school performance metrics and data visualization.

The product was a progressive web app built using Vue/Nuxt.js powered by Django and Firebase.

The app also included Oswald Labs' accessibility features to make it more usable for student with dyslexia, visual impairment, and more disabilities, along with a chatbot to answer students' frequently asked questions which could be trained by all teachers.

The branding and pitch were inspired from CGP Grey's video, [Digital Aristotle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M).
