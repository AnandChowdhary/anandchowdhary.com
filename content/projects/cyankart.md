Cyankart.com is India's most popular online fashion store for phone cases and apparel items. They were looking to expand their mobile reach and increase conversions, so I was hired to redesign their ecommerce website and provide logistics-related backend solutions. A/B testing, source code minification, image optimization, and responsive cross-platform mobile-first Liquid theme development are just some of the complicated words I used while working with Cyankart to expand their mobile reach and increase conversions.

The biggest challenge was decreasing the load time. I optimized images, minified the code, and decreased the usage of additions libraries and instead wrote vanilla CSS and JavaScript. The most important part was creating user engagement, so A/B testing on both the navigation bar and product layouts was done to ensure that we delivered the best experience. Little changes like the color of the"'Buy Now" button made significant difference to sale.
