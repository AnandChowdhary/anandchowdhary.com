In June 2016, I had the idea of developing a browser extension for users with dyselxia which could redesign webpages to make them easier to read. Nishant and I built the extension during a weekend hackathon, AngelHack Delhi 2016, where we won the Code4Impact Challenge.

> The duo decided to learn more about web accessibility features for people with dyslexia and learning disabilities, discussed suitable colours and fonts, and finally came up with Oswald in June this year. The Chrome extension helps people with dyslexia and visual impairment, as well as senior citizens. Currently, the tool is an add-on for only those web browsers that support extensions from the Chrome Web Store â€“ such as Chrome, Opera, Chromium, etc. -- [The Better India](https://www.thebetterindia.com/63239/oswald-web-access-dyslexia-visually-impaired/)
