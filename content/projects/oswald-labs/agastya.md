Agastya is a web accessibility plugin for websites. It has over 20 features, such as dyslexia-friendly reading mode, blind-friendly read aloud, and user customizations features for contrast, font size, etc. I built Agastya as Oswald Labs' first revenue-generating product with a monthly subscription.

Companies can whitelabel Agastya with their branding (colors, logo, etc.) when they incorporate it on their websites. It also gives developers access to advanced analytics about users, browsers, devices, and more. Agastya is free for small websites and a paid subscription for larger companies.

With tens of features, Agastya is the most versatile web accessibility plugin in the world, written with TypeScript and served via Oswald Labs' global content delivery network to our clients. More information is available on the [Agastya website](https://oswaldlabs.com/platform/agastya/).
