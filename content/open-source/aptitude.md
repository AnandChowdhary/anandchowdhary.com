Aptitude is a super-simple theme for one-page articles and projects. It's the next version of essential.css and comes with support for better navigation, icons, and fonts from Typekit. It was created for a page on my website, [Timeless](/timeless/), something I maintain until today.

The usage is very simple, you just have to include this link to your webpage:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.1.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnandChowdhary/normalize.css/master/normalize.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnandChowdhary/aptitude/master/aptitude.min.css">
```

This is what a page looks like with Aptitude:
