Uppload is an open-source JavaScript file uploader. It has built-in support for drag-and-dropping, image cropping, file previews,  Instagram imports, and more. It works with any HTML form backend and has wrappers for Vue.js, React, and Angular, and presets for Firebase and AWS S3.

I pitched the idea of building an open-source file uploading widget as a side project to [El Ni√±o](https://www.elnino.tech), the digital development company I am a consultant to, and I started working on it along with their team. We pushed the first release on NPM in one week, and, in 40 days, we had 200 commits, 80 stars, and 10 forks on GitHub.
