essential.css is a beautiful article template in 786 bytes. Just include the stylesheet link to your webpage and quickly create simple, readable webpages. I made essential.css as a tool to build my personal website and open-sourced it.

I even convinced my middle-school computers teacher to teach using essential.css in her class as a way of making better-looking webpages without having to learn CSS.

The usage is very simple, you just have to include this link to your webpage:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnandChowdhary/essential.css/master/essential.css">
```

This is what a page looks like with essential.css:

<div class="two-images">
  <img alt="" src="/images/open-source/essential1.png">
  <img alt="" src="/images/open-source/essential2.png">
</div>
