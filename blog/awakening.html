				<p>Dawn symbolizes a lot of things, of which sunrise is the only literal meaning. A new hope, a new beginning, fresh thoughts, an opportunity to stop condemning, meet challenges with resolve, pursuits that are remarkable and passion that reflects creation. Stupor and sleep restore confidence and vitality, very much essential to play in the field of life. Beyond shower, tooth-brush and break; time to step out. The stage is set.</p>

				<blockquote class="big">
					<p>Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached!</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>People who set the standards, people who bring in new technologies that completely change the way we work, the way we think and the way we behave. Stupendous performances and heroic acts, and innovation that leaves one in disbelief!</p>

				<p>Excellence in workmanship; perseverance to deliver products and services of high quality each time, are no ordinary feasts for a common man. Not greedy, but being conscious, useful and serving all the time; decisions that convey justice; and relationships that leave others touched. We can be the ones to set the standards, every day!</p>

				<p>Here, I present a few exceptionally brilliant people associated with some extra-ordinary events. Unprecedented situations demanding special adjudications, miraculous products of unheard utility and artistry that transcends times. We may not be here by choice, but the worlds is our choice. We must accept it the way it is and yet, cleanse it with the fire of our knowledge, be the catalyst of change and make this world a better place to live for all.</p>

				<p>Awakening&mdash;no less than the gift of God&mdash;look inside, to be a better part of the world outside.</p>
