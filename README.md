My personal website has changed numerous times over the past decade. The current version is built using Hugo. Previous versions have been built with static HTML, WordPress, Svbtle, etc. You can visit the [Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/anandchowdhary.com) to see previous versions in action.
