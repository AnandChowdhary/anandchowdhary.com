						<p>So, hello.
Researchers have proved after long and industrious study that people with more birthdays tend to live longer. On that pleasant note, a very happy birthday. It's amazing what someone does to you in a brief year, isn't it? They say that it's about the mile-stones not the miles, I'm glad to say I've made a few with you. From the sleepless nights to the irritating afternoons, I'd say we've traveled many paths; from a careful listener to a daring friend, our contrasts on these paths have made our friendship worth a word. To silent pauses and breathless laughter, and the occasional falter, my sincere gratitude  to you. To poetic notions and irritable thoughts, glad to spend time with you. Love,</p>

						<p>Happy budday swataaa. You're one of the most confident and definitely the craziest person I know. Whenever I see you, you're smiling and that's what I like best about you. Here's to all the colony moments and playing in the park when we were kids( remember?), studying together and basically having so much fun. Always remain the way you are. Love youu&lt;3</p>

						<p>Happy birthday swati. Yes I do remember your birthday okayy. So you're finally turning 16 eh. Anyway, we've had this weird history, where there was a point when you hated me. But I guess it was in kechla when we became close friends. I get this feeling that you think that I don't like you, but that's not true. I admire your ability to be frank with people and tbh you're a nice person swats. Yeah..we lost touch in between,but I'm glad you're in my class now and hopefully we can be close friends again. Ilove you. Have a great day and year ahead.</p>
