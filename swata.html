						<p>So, hello.
Researchers have proved after long and industrious study that people with more birthdays tend to live longer. On that pleasant note, a very happy birthday. It's amazing what someone does to you in a brief year, isn't it? They say that it's about the mile-stones not the miles, I'm glad to say I've made a few with you. From the sleepless nights to the irritating afternoons, I'd say we've traveled many paths; from a careful listener to a daring friend, our contrasts on these paths have made our friendship worth a word. To silent pauses and breathless laughter, and the occasional falter, my sincere gratitude  to you. To poetic notions and irritable thoughts, glad to spend time with you. Love,</p>

						<p>Happy budday swataaa. You're one of the most confident and definitely the craziest person I know. Whenever I see you, you're smiling and that's what I like best about you. Here's to all the colony moments and playing in the park when we were kids( remember?), studying together and basically having so much fun. Always remain the way you are. Love youu&lt;3</p>

						<p>Happy birthday swati. Yes I do remember your birthday okayy. So you're finally turning 16 eh. Anyway, we've had this weird history, where there was a point when you hated me. But I guess it was in kechla when we became close friends. I get this feeling that you think that I don't like you, but that's not true. I admire your ability to be frank with people and tbh you're a nice person swats. Yeah..we lost touch in between,but I'm glad you're in my class now and hopefully we can be close friends again. Ilove you. Have a great day and year ahead.</p>

						<p>Dear Swati,
Just because I don't attend somebody's birthday party, or pester them about my birthday even though their's is so much closer, or annoy them, or anything, doesn't mean I don't LOVE them! HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I hope you have a really really really really beautiful birthday and may the year ahead be full of happiness. I will NEVER forget all the stuff we did in class sixth- and we've come such a long way from how we were then, but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna cherish those memories for ever and ever. Keep smiling and keep laughing and stay happy because that's how I like you best. Happy sixteenth again, perhaps we finally need to get you that male prostitute you've been asking for</p>

						<p>Superswaaatttiiii!! HAPPYYY BIRTHDAYYY!  Finally! So where do I begin? You're such an awesome person. Thanks for always being there for me,  listening to me and never judging me.  You're so nice and extremely modest.  ( Bachpan se) you're this hyperactive ball of cuteness. You're one of the sweetest and sabse nice people I know. You're also the only person I've met who is more birthday obsessed than I am.  Always happy happy and making everyone happy. Yours walrus wave, mannnn. Woaahh.  and how can I not mention your amazing artistic skills? you're really pretty, so stop denying it okay? Omg, I iz so cheesy. And has anyone ever told you that you give incredible piggy back rides?  Anyway, I just want you to know that you mean a lot to me and stay the same weird, awesome and walrusy person you are. Love you 234567891011 much. Don't change. Happyy birthdayayyayay. *fangirl screech* </p>

						<p>Swatiiii. Happy birthdayyy. The youngest one is 16. Hahahaha. I guess since it's your birthday, it would be fitting to recapitulate the good ol' times that we've spent together, the transaction from preteens to teens, the adjustment to this social hierarchy called the senior wing, all the growing up we did alongside one another. Your presence in my life has adorned my early teens with some whacky yet worthy memories that's for sure. I would in a second forsake the vexatious time period that we wasted in fighting, and will just say I'm glad we made amends and that you're in my class now. You're talented, filled with effervescence and actually very sensible when you want to be. Anyways, have a great day, a beautiful life, and to sum it up, you're a little dose of crazy everyone could do with in their lives:)

						<p>Swati Arun. You have turned sixteen mera baby. Yayayaya. Finally that day of the year is here which you wait for for practically from the next day of your birthday. Gosh. So big girl, you have been there with me for the past 3 years, out of which 1 and a half have been completely fabulous. 
Now, enough of this formality happy birthday stuff. Swati, in these three years what I have developed with you might be edit, is the best thing which could ever happen. You have made my life a joyride. I don't care what wrong is happening in the world now. I only care about you and your welfare. Love. You made me understand and redefine the meaning of this little 4 letter word. And for me love is only and only you. People throw around this word here and there for practically everything, I have understood the gravity of this word by falling for you. A year ago I was nervous as shit as I didn't plan anything for you. This year I really wanted to do something really special, hence I started to plan from January. But dumb me I lost all my progress mid way. I remembered how you told me that no one would be able to come to you on your birthday and how you really wanted to meet everyone. So this site which is made by his holiness Anand Chowdhary is a small medium by which I am trying to bring all the people to you. Swati, believe me, all these people love you. You have done so much for them in their lives. Each and every one of them. Yes, some did end negatively but all of them love you. Remember, you have an army of friends. Who will always stand for you. And these are a few of them. And then there is this douchebag. (Me) I am the luckiest person on this earth to get you. You have made my life worth living. And anyone who has read except you who have read it till here might be thinking that I am such an emotional freak. Anyway, you have known me better than anybody else. I have shared so much with you which I haven't and couldn't with anyone else. You have taught me so many things (you know what I mean). So Swati Arun, here's to the crazy fun times we have had together. And to those too which we will encounter. Thank you my love, for the time of my life. And I shall keep my promise of making sure that a flicker of sadness never comes on that pretty pretty face of yours. I love you Nini. Happy birthday love. Have the best time ahead. Hope you liked this. PS, thank Anand. </p>
