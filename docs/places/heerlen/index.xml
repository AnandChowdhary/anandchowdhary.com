      <description>The product was a progressive web app built using Vue/Nuxt.js powered by Django and Firebase.
The app also included Oswald Labs&amp;rsquo; accessibility features to make it more usable for student with dyslexia, visual impairment, and more disabilities, along with a chatbot to answer students&amp;rsquo; frequently asked questions which could be trained by all teachers.
      The branding and pitch were inspired from CGP Grey&amp;rsquo;s video, Digital Aristotle.</description>
