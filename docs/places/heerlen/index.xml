      <description>Between November 29 and December 1, 2018, my team and I built and presented Aristotle, an AI-powered e-learning platform for the schools of Limburg. The app was the winner of the Education category at Brighthack in Heerlen.
For students, it automatically finds the best content from a variety of sources (like Khan Academy, Wikipedia, study material websites, etc.), and offers gamification and quizzes to better understand the syllabus. For teachers, it offers actionable analytics such as per-student performance.</description>
