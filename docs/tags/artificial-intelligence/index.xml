      <description>In November 2017, I worked with Trivago in DÃ¼sseldorf on building an app to help refugees find jobs in Europe. RefuServe is a chatbot app that helps you develop your skills by recommending videos and translating them in your native language, along with automatically generating resumes for you in multiple languages. No matter where you&amp;rsquo;re from, RefuServe will help you find a job in Europe.

      <description>For the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Hackathon at The Future of High Tech, part of the Startup Fest Europe 2017, I developed FaceMatch, a mobile app that uses deep learning-based facial detection, and displays the results in an augmented reality heads-up display. I ended up winning the hackathon&amp;rsquo;s grand prize of â‚¬1,000 along with VIP tickets for StartupFest Europe.

   The idea is simple â€” if you enter a large conference or a room full of people, you want to know who you should network with.</description>

      <description>Naari (meaning woman in Hindi) is the end-to-end period healthcare companion&amp;mdash;from giving you personalized tampon recommendations using P&amp;amp;G&amp;rsquo;s survey data and HPE&amp;rsquo;s machine learning APIs&amp;mdash;to getting those products delivered to your doorstep via Amazon.
 Great use of machine learning to drive a benefit for women. &amp;ndash; Erik Hasenoehrl, Research Fellow, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble
 Naari is also a social platform that lets you chat with your doctor, friends, or anonymously in a group to find someone who has previously experienced what you are experiencing and express yourself freely, and get a daily curated feed of women&amp;rsquo;s health articles and news from leading journals.</description>
