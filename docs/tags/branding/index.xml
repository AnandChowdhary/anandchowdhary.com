      <description>I designed a minimal logo and Shopify ecommerce store for Crink Jewel, a precious jewelry company based in New Delhi, India. I tried to portray elegance, simplicity, and timelessness.

      <description>In June 2017, I organized BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. Programmers, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs came together to build products to make lives better. Organized in collaboration with Facebook Developer Circle Delhi-NCR, BharatHacks helped hundreds take their idea forward, from hacking to raising investment and launching their products in the market.
BharatHacks was free for both entrepreneurs and hackers, to join hands and work towards a better India. From a pool of over 1,000 applicants, we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen the top 200 to participate at BharatHacks.</description>

      <description>In early 2017, Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi and I co-founded Melangebox, a fashion ecommerce startup. I designed the brand identity and developed a mobile-first Shopify store, and Mahendra handled the production, inventory, and shipping. In mid-2018, we had grown to over ₹50,000 ($750) in revenue every day and continue to grow.

      <description>In mid-2016, my girlfriend Sukriti Kapoor and I conceptualized a fashion brand that combines western clothing with ethnic Indian designs. She worked on fabric and fashion design while I designed the brand identity and website.

      <description>The idea is pretty simple — like in the movie, we need a personal healthcare companion, someone who can help us medically when we need it to, both by providing the right information to us and helping us get in touch with the right medical professionals.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve stubbed your toe a little, Baymax will tell you how to make the swelling go away and will help you get well by providing a treatment.</description>

      <description>SixteenInches.com is one of the fastest-growing online supplements store. It was built on a foundation of authenticity and quality-control, both of which currently lack the healthcare industry. I was hired to design the SixteenInches&amp;rsquo; brand identity, including logo and social media design, and a responsive ecommerce website on the WordPress platform using Woocommerce, to convey their mission.
I chose red as the primary brand color because it represents power and passion.</description>

      <description>Music has always been an integral part of our lives. Ever since people started using the internet, they&amp;rsquo;ve been downloading music and movies. The process became relatively simple with the introduction of Napster in 1999, which led to the development of many such tools. I remember growing up with Limewire and Bearshare. After the discontinuation of these services in after ten long years, downloading music became really complicated again.
In the 2010s, people stream music on YouTube or Spotify or SoundCloud and use conversion tools to download MP3 files, or use services such as BeeMP3 or MP3Skull which are full of advertisements, fake links, and incomplete collections.</description>

      <description>From late 2014 to early 2016, I worked as the Technology Lead at Justice Adda, a startup part of Cambridge Social Ventures in the Judge Business School, University of Cambridge. I designed their early website and webapps like Intolerance Tracker. I also worked on their branding, and this is a small Paul Rand-inspired magazine I designed to showcase the new brand.

      <description>Project Blue, originally standing for &amp;lsquo;Bottles, Linkages, and their Underlining Ergonomics,&amp;rsquo; is my first (and only) industrial design project in which I conducted a research and redesigned the plastic bottle. I understood that polyethene terephthalate, a plastic resin and the most common type of polyester, is the material which makes the popular &amp;lsquo;PET&amp;rsquo; bottles.
According to the National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR), the gross water bottle recycling rate was only 38.</description>

      <description>Cyankart.com is India&amp;rsquo;s most popular online fashion store for phone cases and apparel items. They were looking to expand their mobile reach and increase conversions, so I was hired to redesign their ecommerce website and provide logistics-related backend solutions. A/B testing, source code minification, image optimization, and responsive cross-platform mobile-first Liquid theme development are just some of the complicated words I used while working with Cyankart to expand their mobile reach and increase conversions.</description>

      <description>You see this meticulously made handicraft item which would be the perfect addition to brighten up any living room. You pick it up, admiring the attention to detail when suddenly you spot the Made in India label at the bottom, instantly making the product you were admiring seconds ago feel as cheap as dirt.
Why is it that a Made in Italy label makes people feel as if the product had been made in heaven itself?</description>

      <description>Unlike all stories, ClassRebels didn&amp;rsquo;t start with the simple idea of making teachers and students connect in a way they&amp;rsquo;ve never connected before. It started with an idea to bring about a reform, a change, and a revolution. In India, this change was long needed. The society is evolving, and our education system needs to catch up.
We believe that the whole idea of education is taken in the wrong sense.</description>

      <description>I recently participated in an event where I was required to redesign Internet.org&amp;rsquo;s homepage and logo. The content had to remain the same, but the design was to be completely new. The website was required to be responsive, and good in code-quality and aesthetics, without the use of any external code. The logo was marked for creativity and execution. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I designed in five hours. And why.
