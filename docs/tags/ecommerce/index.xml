      <description>Cyankart.com is India&amp;rsquo;s most popular online fashion store for phone cases and apparel items. They were looking to expand their mobile reach and increase conversions, so I was hired to redesign their ecommerce website and provide logistics-related backend solutions. A/B testing, source code minification, image optimization, and responsive cross-platform mobile-first Liquid theme development are just some of the complicated words I used while working with Cyankart to expand their mobile reach and increase conversions.</description>
