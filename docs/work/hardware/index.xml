      <description>From February to April 2018, my project group and I worked with IBM on building an escape room using—and to teach players about—the Internet of Things. Using Wemoses and Ardiuos as the basic building blocks, combined with Firebase&amp;rsquo;s real-time database and a custom-built Vue.js app, we built a proof-of-concept with five connected puzzles.
This was my project for the module &amp;ldquo;Living and Working Tomorrow&amp;rdquo;, a quarter of Creative Technology BSc&amp;rsquo;s first year focused on working with external clients on solving today&amp;rsquo;s problems using tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s technology.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BlueBoard is a Bluetooth-powered smart billboard that actually cares about you. Privacy-first and context-aware, it connects with your smartphone via Bluetooth and shows you relevant advertisements and information.&lt;/p&gt;
