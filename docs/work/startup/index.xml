      <description>In early 2017, Mahendra Singh Raghuwanshi and I co-founded Melangebox, a fashion ecommerce startup. I designed the brand identity and developed a mobile-first Shopify store, and Mahendra handled the production, inventory, and shipping.
In mid-2018, we had grown to over â‚¹50,000 ($750) in revenue every day and continue to grow.

      <description>In mid-2016, my girlfriend Sukriti Kapoor and I conceptualized a fashion brand that combines western clothing with ethnic Indian designs. She worked on fabric and fashion design while I designed the brand identity and website.

      <description>Unlike all stories, ClassRebels didn&amp;rsquo;t start with the simple idea of making teachers and students connect in a way they&amp;rsquo;ve never connected before. It started with an idea to bring about a reform, a change, and a revolution. In India, this change was long needed. The society is evolving, and our education system needs to catch up.
We believe that the whole idea of education is taken in the wrong sense.</description>
