      <description>In June 2017, I organized BharatHacks, a hackathon for solving India-specific problems. Programmers, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs came together to build products to make lives better. Organized in collaboration with Facebook Developer Circle Delhi-NCR, BharatHacks helped hundreds take their idea forward, from hacking to raising investment and launching their products in the market.
BharatHacks was free for both entrepreneurs and hackers, to join hands and work towards a better India. From a pool of over 1,000 applicants, we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen the top 200 to participate at BharatHacks.</description>
