      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two months after writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://anandchowdhary.com/blog/state-of-the/podcasts/2018/&#34;&gt;State of the Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, where I talked about my go-to podcasts in 2018, this post is about the apps that find their home on my laptop&amp;rsquo;s dock. These apps are those I use most often and make me much more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; consuming audio content in the form of podcasts and audiobooks about two years ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m very often asked what podcasts I listen to. This is the first list in a series of reviews about my daily drivers of content, services, and products.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UTwente PeoplePages Contact Book</title>
      <link>https://anandchowdhary.com/blog/utwente-peoplepages/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a future creative technology student at the University of Twente, I wanted to get in touch with a particular professor. Their website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.utwente.nl/&#34;&gt;PeoplePages&lt;/a&gt;, uses a RESTful API for AJAX requests to search for university staff, so I decided to add everyone to my contacts using API scraping to save time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I took fifteen minutes to make some strategic design changes to Zomato’s Android app. I wrote extensively about the iconography, typography, and role of actions in the app’s user experience. I wrote this article originally in March 2016 for the Zomato Android team and publically published it on Medium in April 2017 since Zomato decided to implement most of my design changes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a little bit of background about my college &amp;ldquo;situation&amp;rdquo;. How I went from design school in India to back to New Delhi to the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I wrote this post in March 2017 and updated it in December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I tried to reset my password on PR.com, the press releases website. I entered my email, and they sent me the username and password in plain text. That&amp;rsquo;s right, in plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
