				<p>Hello.</p>

				<p>My name is <a href="/about">Anand Chowdhary</a>, and I make <em>useful</em> things.</p>

				<p>I believe that design is the art of expressing thoughts; it&rsquo;s a freehand manifestation of vision. It is the draftsman&rsquo;s job to use lab instruments to reflect that vision into precision. The purpose of design is to understand how best we can absorb natural elements spread all around us.</p>

				<p>Lack of knowledge creates too many complexities around us. Outside wisdom is unlikely to remove these intricacies. It is from the study of the self, through concentration and practice, emerges design. Total simplicity of the cosmic order. From creation to another creation, and yet another. Unlimited forms, shapes, variants and matter – all bound together by the invisible force of life.</p>

				<div class="hr"></div>

				<p>Symmetry in true harmony, yet not perfectly symmetrical. Continuous friction causing everything to turn round-cornered. How visually appealing look the electrons in an atom, or iOS icons! It is that appeal in the design that raises inquisitiveness to know more of the unknown.</p>

				<p>Sometimes, even surpassing logic.</p>

				<p>Design is future. It&rsquo;s a reaction against the contemporary, both technology and belief system. It is, in its most fundamental form, a blueprint which lays the foundation for newer development. It is simplification, not just limited to the removal of clutter, but how an idea is transformed into a solution, and how that solution works, bringing order to complexity.</p>

				<div class="hr"></div>

				<p>Inter-dependence is intrinsic to design. Just like in a machine, different parts behave differently to serve distinct objectives; and to that end not only do they work in harmony but also are interdependent, to receive and to deliver, meeting the intended aim. Civilization, spread through thousands of years of natural evolution, has established societies functioning with different classes of people in total inter-dependence.</p>

				<p>A similar inter-dependence is between How and Why. As <a href="http://shapeofdesignbook.com" target="_blank" title="The Shape of Design by Frank Chimero, Chapter 1">Frank Chimero</a> says,</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The relationship between form and purpose—How and Why—is symbiotic. But despite this link, Why is usually neglected, because How is more easily framed. It is easier to recognize failures of technique than those of strategy or purpose, and simpler to ask “How do I paint this tree?” than to answer “Why does this painting need a tree in it?”</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>When you understand the objective and the context of a work, you answer the Why, and that&rsquo;s when you think about the How and start to make it useful. It is that study that makes things not just usable, but <em>useful</em>.</p>
