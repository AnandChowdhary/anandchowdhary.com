          The easiest thing to do is write me an email at
          mentoring@anandchowhdary.com with what I can help with. I try and
          respond to each email.

        <p>Here are some of the nice things people have said about me:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            A renaissance entrepreneur? That is how I would describe Anand. His
            breadth of entrrprenuerial experience is remarkable even for a
            seasoned serial entrepreneur and ranges from social to for-profit.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Anand gave good feedback from a business as well as from a personal
            perspective. I wish I had talked to him a few month if not years
            earlier.
          </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Anand just immediately gets what I'm trying to do, with minimal
            explanation, and had some really solid advice on future direction.
            Super smart guy.
